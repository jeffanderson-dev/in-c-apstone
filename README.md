# In C[S]

## Goals

- Create multiple "musicians" each playing independently
- Display musician cards showing their current phrase
- Understand state management for multiple entities
- Learn about React's `useState` for arrays of objects
- A grid of musician cards
- Each musician shows which phrase they're currently on
- Musicians all start at phrase 1 and advance together for now
- Visual representation of each musician

## Key Concepts

- Data structures for notes and durations
- Musical note notation ("C4", "E4", etc etc)
- Note durations ('8n' = eighth note, '4n' = quarter note)
- Component composition (MusicianCard component)
- Dynamic styling with inline styles

## Running This Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
