# Adding Audio with Tone.js

## Goals

- Integrate Tone.js library for Web Audio
- Create a simple synthesizer that plays a note
- Make the Play/Pause button control audio
- Understand audio context initialization

## Key Concepts

- Web Audio API basics (via Tone.js)
- `Tone.start()` for initializing audio context
- `Tone.Transport` for timing
- Basic synthesizers and `triggerAttackRelease`
- Async operations (starting audio requires user interaction)

## Running This Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
